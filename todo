- Ideas for bot:
    - Progress since last checked
        - Track when new brawler unlocked?
    - Check match history hourly
        - Check for power play
        - "victory", "draw", "defeat"
    - Track trophy history daily
        - Brawler trophy history?
            - If date already exists, update instead of insert
    - Which brawlers to push
        - By difficulty, or by star points
- Display:
    - Trophy league, power play
        - Time left, trophies after reset, reward @done
        - Time left can be a text progress bar
    - Total rank @done
        - Change from last trophy league?
- Graphs:
    - Trophy history
    - Power play season history
        - Can have specific graphs for win rates, play rates, maps, etc.
